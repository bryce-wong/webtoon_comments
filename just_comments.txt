"My Shot just started to play!"
"I CAUGHT THAT HAMILTON YOU THREW, CUZ I'M NONSTOP HAMILTON!!!"
"Incredibly confused, but I'll try and give the rest of it a shot."
"Someone wants to explain to me why a 5/10* comic is featured on the main page of webtoons and how it came to that rating?"
"What really needs explaining is why such a necessary and well executed comic has such a low rating."
"IS THAT A HAMILTON REFERENCE I SMELL"
"Was that a Hamilton bit right there?!?"
"understood nothing :("
"Shit, thought i was the only one."
"thank goodness im not the only one"
"the reference or the comic in general?"
"I can already tell this is an amazing comic, like Rent and How to Survive a Plague mixed but with a little more humor and smiles"
"WHERE NOT GONNA PAY LAST YEARS THIS YEARS NEXT YEARS RENTV"
"Hopefully the story has a message behind dugs"

"I'm confused... I don't understand the sequence huhu sorry"
"This story is all over the damn place. & I'm really trying to get it, but I just don't."

"that is one polit dealer"
"Wait, the trainer is positive and might have infected his ex and a child? His ass needs to be in jail"
"I'm so confused not gonna lie."
"I been confused from the get-go tbh"
"The worst thing you can do is not telling people you are positive. His ex and daughter could have it too and spread it because he didn't tell them. Don't know how this is handled in America, but in Germany that's bodily injury and will bring you some years in prison."
"It's pretty much the same in America. There's a story about a man who passed on an STD to over 15 woman and he was sued and sent to jail because he told any of them."
"It's considered assault with a deadly weapon in almost all states, except batshit crazy California."
"Wait, seriously?"

"omg, if this is a true story im gonna cry."
"Even if this isn't, I bet something like this happens all the time. It's scary to me."
"What does detectable mean"
"i think it means that the std or sti (sexually transmitted disease/illness) is found in the blood, its \"detected\" in the blood stream showing that the person is infected?????"
"Ooooooof"
"looks like it's just me and you"
"I'm here"
"Me tooo"
"Me too!"
"met too!"
"Hello."

"WE CAN BLOG ABOUT IT.  <U+0CA0>_<U+0CA0> Does this sound normal to you..?"
"nope"
"Sounds about right especially in 2018"
"I like the general plot of this story, but the chapters are too short and end abruptly."
"aNd PeGgy"

"I love his friends"
"AND PEGGY"
"my name is angelica and I'll be honest I can't even enjoy Hamilton anymore"
"Ugh, this is exhausting & I'm Beyond confused. At least i can say that i gave it a shot. I give the rest of you props for being able to follow the story."
"I might try again, see if I can better understand."
"I feel you man. The concept seemed cool, but I have no idea what<U+0092>s going on in this story"
"Yea, too scattered every which way."
"Rich has six fingers?"
"Huh? Where?"
"AWWWW PEGGYS HERE"
"but I thought prep doesn't prevent hiv?"
"It doesn't provide 100% protection but it does help prevent it. You still have to be careful and preferably use a condom"
"Damn, his mom and ex-foster parents suck ass"
"And this is why I will die in the closet"
"what is the HAMILTON?"
"A popular Broadway musical."
"I also want to watch Hamilton."
"Sad"
"CAN I GET FREE TIX TO HAMILTON?!?!?!"
"Do these idiots WANT to spread aids???"
"Who knows, maybe they didn't pay attention in Health class."
"Don<U+0092>t they realize you can still get infected by oral"
"thats y the guy said he wasnt detectable, but the guy said he dont care"
"Wait, what? Really? That's shocking to know. Interesting(that sounds kinda bad..) But hmm.."
"Ur bro going... monkey poo..?"
"ape shit"
"Terrence's brother is a little sh*t, but give the kid a break. He just found out his older brother has HIV and lied about it. I'd be breaking sh*t too if it were me."
"KICK. HIM. OUT."
"then leave the house then"
"THIS LIL S H . I T"
"Those scratches are BS! He might end up infected"
"Then good"
"That's not how it works."
"Can I call the lil bro a pain in the a$$ ?"
"An ungrateful pain in the ass"
"Ouuuuuch"
"I don't get it...which Hamilton character is this guy?"
"that's what I was wondering"
"I<U+0092>m not sure if he<U+0092>s Hercules Mulligan or an extra dancer"
"yeah i was thinking he might be hercules mulligan (but idk much about him bcuz my parents always make me skips the parts of the songs with him in them)"
"yea...."
"Damn, this story is keepin it 100."
"he just yeeted them so hard"
"Aaaaaaaah!!!"
"yo this is sad"
"At least somebody cares on like mom and her boyfriend"
"I know enough about Rikers from TV to know it isn't somewhere you want to end up"
"Outcome 1: If he<U+0092>d been a white kid. Outcome 2: Reality check. Man I think this series is going to break my heart."
"WHY IS HE SUCH A GOOD BROTHER"
"oh nooooo rikers is a very bad prison my fam were talking about it last night oof"
"Also was one a positive outcome that he made in his mind a and the other the true outcome"
"Yeah"
"a Brother Gotta Do What a Brother Gotta Do"
"Wow, this is a lot of perspective so far! Probs a lot of hard work"
"omg she is so pretty"
"I wanna sub to her"
"deathdroooop"
"I understand Lily was angry. BUT that's an abused teen who just found out about HIS brother. His aggressive attitude was wrong but Lily should have showed some type of restraint."
"Well, yeah, but she was shocked by looking the brother was going to move in, angry at how the brother was being disrespectful and afraid of the feel of being discriminate."
"Adults who fight children are pathetic. Reign in that temper and act like an adult, is what I think."
"I feel like it depends how old she is. If she<U+0092>s like 19-20, I can understand getting mad enough to fight a teenager cause you basically still are one. But past 21? You need to keep your hands to yourself."
"\"It's 2am and I still ain't done, y'all\" LMAO Lily out here being a whole mood goddamn"
"I love this comic and I love how real it is. Thanks author!"
"I love being Canadian"
"lol"
"The best Canadian is Jordan Peterson"
"so running around in the streets with signs is going to change who our president is? i don't think so. trump is out president now (no matter how much of an idiot he is)."
"Unfortunately..."
"well yeah, but nevertheless he is our president"
"That doesn<U+0092>t mean people can<U+0092>t make themselves heard."
"they shouldn't if 'making themselves heard' means running around in the streets and disrupting the peace just because they don't like the president! he's not a dictator, or a murderer! he's just stupid and he cusses a lot. it could be worse (but you know who are bad? the idiots who go around protesting things that they cannot change. it is a waste of time and energy)"
"Well, though sometimes I think protesting is useless, that way people who haven't heard about them can listen to them. But I also think they should get into action. Like getting lawyers to help them change the law."
"Protesting is a call to change  something people WANT to change. A start. If women didn<U+0092>t protest and march for equal rights, there a fair chance we wouldn<U+0092>t have made progress. Besides, it<U+0092>s more than <U+0093>they don<U+0092>t like the president<U+0094>. They disagree with the decisions being made, and want it to change. It COULD be worse, but just because it could be worse doesn<U+0092>t mean they have to be satisfied with the unsatisfactory."
"I didn<U+0092>t mean to go off, but figured I<U+0092>d voice my piece. Everyone deserves a chance <U+2640><U+FE0F>"
"naoir I don't think that anyone could have explained it better than that. thank you."
"i think AoiYeyi explained it best"
"We just explained it differently as there are different ways to interpret it and different aspects to being up. Thank you though teasipper and thank you happycat for not being upset by my lengthy response. Hope everyone has a lovely day. <U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"Well I'm glad that we can respectfully disagree instead of screaming out heads off like the people on the news."
"It<U+0092>s in the constitution that Americans can peacefully protest, so they<U+0092>re just exercising their constitutional rights as citizens of this country. My mother is a 19yr veteran of the US. Army/National Guard, she fought overseas so people could exercise their rights. There<U+0092>s a reason why our constitution still stands!"
"This story telling is bomb af!"
"Love how she<U+0092>s just going drugs all chill on her channel"
"...I thought they both knew he was moving in?"
"no that was what the brother was hoping was going to happen. it was his imagination. if ya get what i mean"
"LGBT Rule"
"I like Lily - she's tough, but kind"
"<U+0093>See? Now we<U+0092>re friends, it<U+0092>s just that easy.<U+0094> Oh Lily  I wish everyone thought way."
"Lily has a passion and she isn't afraid to show it#GOGIRL"
"I always find the diversity of comments in this comic so interesting"
"We stan a trans KWEEN"
"Lily is the best omg"
"It's not nice to make fun of trans or gay people even if they are wrong. And srsly! threatening to kill someone's child is just awful!"
"What do you mean by wrong?"
NA
"how is being trans or gay wrong?"
"Hey, guess what. I<U+0092>m trans and gay. You gonna tell me I<U+0092>m wrong?"
"@gilleanfryingpan: yes. you are wrong. but God still loves you just like He loves every single human being he made"
"and to the rest of you: being trans and/or gay is wrong because the bible says it is"
"also, just in case you didn't notice, the point of this comment was to say that being mean to LGBTQ people is wrong and not to point out the wrongness of being LGBTQ. I also did not mean this as a hate coment. I can still be civil to you while disagreeing with you, and disagreeing with you does not automatically mean that I hate you."
"reported"
"not everybody believes in god"
"@Juliette owo  Yes, not everyone believes in God, but for the people who do, like me and the OP, we try to live the way Christ did. And I<U+0092>m gonna tell you right now, no where in the Bible does it say God hates homosexuals. It DOES say that He hates homosexuality, there<U+0092>s a difference. It is absolutely ok to love the sinner, hate the sin, cause that<U+0092>s what Jesus did/does."
"wow. thanks @RedtheGreyFox. i honestly expected that no one was going to agree with me when i posted this (and i did get a lot of that). but i'm glad somebody does (:"
"haha, that guy is going to be shocked when the truth of anatomy comes up."
"Shouldn't Lilly be with the man who she's living with? Is she cheating on that poor man?"
"No, they<U+0092>re just roommates. Remember the guy has multiple male partners. We don<U+0092>t know her sexuality yet, we just know she<U+0092>s trans"
"<U+0093>But gimme three days and my legs look like Beyonc<e9><U+0092>s weave<U+0094> MOOD"
"do you but be careful"
"I hope Lily finds true love!"
"You just have to take that risk darling! Without living in your truth, are you living at all?"
"If he<U+0092>s not willing to look past your gender and see how amazing and beautiful you are, he<U+0092>s not worth it."
"Or maybe he wants to date a real women and have the chance to have children with her. Can't do that with a trans."
"^^ There are other ways to have a family than traditional ways."
"Why would anyone hate you?"
"because some people don't like to date trans people for very valid reasons."
"Like what..?"
"idk people are werid like that, they wouldn't want to date someone trans because they think its werid that someone swicthed genders or maybe they are scared of it."
"People want to date real men or women because maybe they want to have children with them one day and you can't do that with a trans."
"@Kingslayer you do realize trans people can get surgery and medically transition from ftm or mtf? Also, calling someone \"a trans\" shows you really don't respect transgender people if you reduce them to their gender identity. Trans women are just as valid as cisgender women, so stop talking like trans women are inherently inferior"
"so what"
"ASSumptions XD"
"You gotta love it when even the judges are bigoted!"
"Just bein a judge and asking real questions."
"Well he didn't specify what situation where they living. If the judge meant living with a transwoman then it is prejudice."
"A lot of judges are short tempered, but it<U+0092>s better than the parents"
"I totally get her fear, but if they are going to do the do, it's super important to tell him!!"
"\"He\" just said planning a shadow two days in advance and it takes a lot to be a dude. He's a trans just like Lily!"
"OMG. I love your guess!"
"I have a bad feeling about this..."
"Hope it turns out great for Lily."
"You don<U+0092>t interrupt someone if they have something important to say"
"I feel a ship coming on"
"just say it"
"Prayin<U+0092> for the baby"
"Hopefully the kid won<U+0092>t, having a child with HIV is just cruel to the child."
"But is it better to have an abortion?"
"@gilleanfryingpan It seems that she wants the baby, though. So she would rather not abort her child."
"Yeeeeee GO LiLY!!!"
"I'm so nervous!!"
"I still say he's a trans too."
"Aaaah I hope this turns out okay!!"
"Yey Lily! Amazing!"
"proud of you Lily, take the first step"
"SHE HAD ONE DAMN JOB"
"Couldn't do it"
"the worst part is that she knew they were coming she knew but uuuuuuugh"
"Exactly Lily knew. Just like I said when she scratched his face. Lily needs to realize that her actions affect others."
"NOOO!!!!! Lily ruined it!!! Poor Dewan"
"Dammit, Lily! Ya dun goofed *facepalm*"
"..."
"Whoa, what a selfish person"
"ooooooh NNOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!"
"shitttt"
"ohh no.."
"DAMNIT LILYWE. WERE. ALL.ROOTINGFORYOU!!!"
"Well, she just proved the judge right..."
"Shit"
"Crap"
"Well that was terrible timing"
"Lily was wrong to have made out with that guy without full disclosure."
"I appreciate all of this  comic in its entirety. I like lily, I think she<U+0092>s someone I<U+0092>d get along with, but I also think I<U+0092>d be that person standing between lily and Terrance trying to get them to see where each other is coming from. Bless his heart though I<U+0092>d be pissed"
"I feel sorry for Lily but I can't blame the dude for kicking her out because of what she did. *sigh* My mind feels so conflicted."
"She needs to stop making herself out to be the victim. She probably damned the chances of that boy ever having a normal stable life due to one bad decision and all she<U+0092>s thinking about is how some sorry SOB rejected her. <U+0093>How am I going to be accepted blah blah blah...<U+0094>Never mind a fifteen year old is either going to be stuck behind bars or thrown in the system again because of her. Sis needs to get her priorities in check and stop making everything about her...."
"But when she was talking to the dude she WAS focused on the fact that she screwed up, I feel like the only reason why the other stuff was talking about being accepted is because of the way the guy told her he didn<U+0092>t wanna be involved with her."
"LILY IS A KWEEN"
"Oh well, it<U+0092>s his loss! Ain<U+0092>t got no time for transphobes:-)"
"how is he a transphobe??"
"Because he didn<U+0092>t want to continue dating her because he thought of her as a man, he even said <U+0093>I<U+0092>m not gay<U+0094>. Which is stupid, because she<U+0092>s a woman."
"He is a man. He will always be a man. You can't change your DNA."
"@Talsong Kingslayer SHE is not a man. SHE is a trans Woman! You need to do some studying up on what that means, because if you did you would know that there is a part of the brain that tells you who/what you are, and in transgender people that part of the brain tells them the opposite of what they were born as. A trans-males brain looks the same as a cis-males brain. A trans-females brain looks the same as a cis-females brain. DO SOME RESEARCH"
"Oh I did plenty of research and that has not been peer reviewed at all. The \"research\" is not supported at all. But nice try."
"Oh no. I understand how he feels but she is a woman now. Oh this is breaking my heart."
"and its not the same and you know it"
"The dad said in an earlier episode that he DIDN'T tell his ex he was positive and he was worried about his 4yr old. So he's possibly the reason the mom has it. UNLESS she was the one on the low and gave it to him!"
"Those faces are such MOODS"
"The little girls face is me 24/7"
"Elena, isn<U+0092>t that the girl at the fashion course who does have HIV?"
"Yeah the one that Lily became friends with"
"The girls face at the end tho."
"omg I love understanding doctors <U+2764>"
"I wonder if she gave it to him or if he gave it to her, but I wonder if it really matters at all"
"It's a shame she feels she couldn't tell the grandma. I hope she's had the 4yr old tested."
"The doctor is so nice :)"
"I love this a lot. the art is pretty. and the stories are relatable to me. keep it up"
"Why are people so negative about aids?"
"So I just said <U+0093>watch yo profan<ef>ty, and the <U+0093>an<ef>ty<U+0094> is being bleeped out!! See? Prof***. Anity. A N I T Y. ANITY. What does *** mean? I can say fuck on here, but not ***?"
"I laughed way too hard at this comment"
"prof***"
"bruhhh"
"prof***"
"watch yo profan<ef>ty"
"and now i dont like the grandmother. i know thats his daughter but he literally has no place to take her so now this woman's child to different places of people she dont even know while shes in the process of giving birth. abuela is inconsiderate"
"So he gave HIV to the mom who is having the baby. I thought these were separate stories, but I kinda like the all fused"
"We don't know how each of them contracted HIV, it could of been two unrelated things. It seems that they both don't know about the other's status."
"i don't understand these parents. I mean I understand these people exist and how they think,its a kind of thinking i dont understand how one could actually fully back up though. To fully disown your own child over little things in the big picture... Why can't parents just accept the dice rolls and coin flips of life don't always go how they want."
"Because they want thing their own way, they are not open to what can happen to life."
"Could depend on what they did that made the parent bitter toward them. If the parent raised them well but the child still turns out horrible because of personality conflict-like the parent telling the child to stay away from something but the child does it anyway, there<U+0092>s not much that can be done"
"If you see a hate comment hit the report link to the right of the username and date. Don't feed the trolls by commenting to them. Report them and move along."
"Awwww, I hope the girl is safe with her papi!!"
"fuck gays"
"you heard me"
"Sorry, I only fuck men with class."
"if you don't have anything nice to say don't say anything at all, b*tch"
"fuck all of you and the gays"
"Haha nice listen you fuck ing nigge r gays should be exterminated along with jews and you included you dumb fuck"
"fuck you"
"oh I didn't notice that typed that  but to be honest with you I do in fact not like homosexuals and I do think it is just an unholy act but the thing about Jews and black people I don't mean any of that I do advise you sir to look it up and see all the diseases and other things that this so called right created I advise you and I am not joking for even a second, to get in touch with God. be open minded and look at all the religions I want what's best for you man sorry for being a bit rude before"
"na is all cool lol I get what your saying it's good to have an open mind but I just hope that you take some of my words and help your self feel and be a better person by following what I said lol I don't want you to think I am like this religious leader or anything but I think if I changed the life of at least one person I would be happy with that that's all I wanted to say and have a nice life"
"hey I'm not in any place to judge you no one in this world can judge you except God and yes have a nice day"
"reported"
"At least the baby is healthy"
"depends on how big your dick is"
"Hit report and ignore the troll."
"Oh no!! He's gonna go to jail?"
"I respect the dad. He'll do whatever it takes to make sure the daughter has a good & safe night."
"Thank you for the author's note!"
"The dad is a good guy at heart <U+2665><U+FE0F><U+2665><U+FE0F>"
"Now that<U+0092>s sweet"
"HIPAA!!! Medical people are not to ever discuss your medical information to ANYONE with out your consent. That nurse would loose her license and the hospital could be sued to hell and back. Know your rights and don't let bigots exploit you. EDIT: In the USA if you don't like your nurse (for any reason) you can ask for a different nurse."
"Noooooooo!!!"
"HIPAA dude, shes gonna get fined thousands if there is a suit and possibly jail time."
"okay that nurse would be fired immediately. that's a huge law she just broke."
"id fight that rude b*tch"
"That nurse is about to be sued"
"Well shit"
"Shit is about to hit the fan"
"Clearly tact and regard for patience privacy aren't a concern for this nurse. Fire her."
"I hate that nurse"
"That nurse just committed so many HIPAA violations..."
"So she can get free healthcare after suing the nurse!"
"FUCK THE REDHEAD"
"yex sis that silly red head heaux can get cut periodt"
"Just binged the whole series so far. I love it! Please keep writing these stories <U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"I REALLY hope everything works out for Lily.."
"I hope they give it another try"
"Forget you redhead."
"Well than"
"that nurse is rude af"
"honestly this is my new favorite comic it talks about real stuff in the world and i love it."
"Thanks to Featured, I discovered this comic and I love it! Keep up the amazing work, author, and keep on being realistic with the topics! <U+2764>"
"This really hits home for me. I work at a clinic in Nebraska called NAP and I<U+0092>ve helped with testing and counseling and the experiences have been eventful from tears of sadness to ones of joy. This comic of course spreads awareness but it sends nice messages too"
"Very interesting comic! It's quickly become one of my favourites on the site."
"I absolutely love this comic I love how it informs people about Truvada and Prep I work for AHF and their sister organization ACQC . When I tell you every day people are positive. and this should all be basic knowledge but isn't taught the way it should be in schools. I have to share this <U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"tbh I don't have these problems but this comic shows me how it feels to be like them."
"So as a straight white cis guy many of the things this comic talks about are foreign to me. However the way the story is presented does a great job  of showing me the \"other side\". Things like this are a brilliant and I love how the story strikes a balance of good and bad. I also appreciate that the story is not pushing out tones of \"your straight go away\" instead I feel educated and enlightened. My best friend from preschool is a trans-woman and  I would never dream of cutting her from my life."
"bless the person who made this"
"I was raped by an armed man at work one day. There was the initial horror of the attack during it, and then the horror that followed it. One of those things that loomed over me after was: What if I have now contracted HIV or another type of disease? How will it effect my health, relationship, and just honestly my whole life? After prophylaxis treatment and continuous testing I was told that I was negative. It really put me into perspective on how people with those diseases live a little."
"Typical gays. always having sex wherever and whenever"
"What gays? Please elaborate on how gays and your homophobia has anything to do with this post."
"This webtoon deserves more recognition and i cant believe i didn<U+0092>t find it earlier. I enjoy how it really reflects human struggles and human nature. (and the Hamilton references) Keep it up!!"
"wow. my birthday is world aids day."
"Me too :)"
"So is my uncles"
"wait I'm really confused about this \"detectable\" thing, or how HIV can become aids. can you touch on this in the comic?"
"i think this comic is a really good thing, it helps spread awareness. its one of thise things in school youre told is bad, but no one really goes into details in whats it really about. or how the lives of others are effected. Thank you. ive had a few friends that were diagnosed snd threw out of thier homes. please continue"
"I like your comic a lot, keep writing <U+270D><U+FE0F>"
"Thank god these disgusting gays have to suffer because of their ignorance"
"Wow you're ignorant, you do realize straight people can get it too right..?"
"Wow, <U+0093>disgusting gays<U+0094>?You sir, belong in the comic."
"That would be great, kyle. I'd kill every single one of these disgusting filth"
"In the U.S. HIV disproportionately affects gay and bisexual men because we don't support them. But in other countries heterosexual couples are the ones most affected by HIV. Do you think they also need to suffer?"
"REPORT THIS GUYS."
"I love how your name is HomoPHOBIC, you are proud of your irrational fear of people who do not affect your life. Good for you!!"
"Why are you reading this if you don<U+0092>t like it?"
"She should<U+0092>ve given him another chance, a daughter should have a good relationship with her father and his family"
"It's cool that you think that, but a lot of my friends grew up without fathers and turned out just fine. Isn't no relationship always better that a toxic one too? I think that no father figure is better than a bad one honestly."
"Well I mean it isn<U+0092>t right that Luis give her hiv but she was stupid to get talked out of not wearing protection but at the the end of the day you made mistakes and now you have to pay for them at least he told you he was the one who gave it to you instead of just leaving you clueless"
"exactly she cant blame him for having another child with a felon. thats all on her and she needs to also accept her fault in things too"
"Awwww"
"<U+0093> Luis is my dealer <U+0093> damn"
"This comic it the BOMB!!!"
"This lady is literally proof that you can find something good in a bad situation with the right support"
"I'm glad Elena's mother change her behavior and it's going to support her."
"I<U+0092>m so glad her Abuela is supportive. <U+0093>You<U+0092>re the love of my life, no matter what<U+0094> reading that made me want to cry"
"Phbt paahahhhahahahahahahah"
"<U+0093>Luis is my dealer<U+0094> What a way to meet someone."
"I relate with Elena so hard. When I was 17, minus the part about the kids similar situation happened. Only my 21 year old boyfriend knew he was positive. I<U+0092>ve tested negative multiple times. But it<U+0092>s still eye opening."
"Life happens man, especially at lower income levels when there isnt always money for things like sitters. It<U+0092>s super rough that this is the cycle things get into"
"this is such a good webtoon omg I love it"
"Damn, they should let it slide, I mean being a good parent is parts of being a good citizen. As the matter of the fact he DIDN'T do anything wrong!"
"Rules are rules. Obviously he can't follow basic rules. If he could, he won't have a parole officer. If you mess up so badly you end up in jail and with a parole officer, you obviously can't handle being an adult and thus need someone to held your hand and punish you when you mess up."
"And yes, he did do something wrong. Parolees are required to check into half way houses before curfew. If you break curfew, you broke the guidelines of your parole and thus need to be punished."
"No one can catch a break in this series"
"Heck"
"He<U+0092>s still a jerk, but I<U+0092>m glad he was willing to violate parole if it meant he could take care of his daughter"
"but i feel thats not fair to him. they knew his situation and if they didnt y would u let ur granddaughter with him. he could go back to jail. the grandmother should have found someone else to watch the daughter"
"One small but important thing: the doctor should say before we *discharge* you, not release. If someone is <U+0093>released<U+0094> from a hospital, that means they were being held they against their will (typically happens in psychiatric wards although not exclusively)"
"I understand the girl saying that stuff because it means she doesn<U+0092>t understand and is parroting the grandmother. But the grandmother needs to shut it and leave Elena alone."
"This WEBTOON is important"
"Thanks for reading :)"
"Can<U+0092>t wait for the next episode, really think Luis should be given another chance"
"I'm glad Elena also explain to her daughter about she having HIV. That's is also super important, because that way Amanda can help her and understand a little what she's going through."
"She needs stability and support full time, he's not going to do that and in the long run that's going to cause a lot of harm for everyone. she needs to just be in a positive environment without the drama and no pushing these ideas of \"she needs him\" especially when he's toxic."
"good thing she's receiving support, but having Amanda's father moving in would be awful, He doesn't seem to be very responsible yet. Sadly in some people's minds is better to have a companion even if the relationship is bad than being single and in a better mental state."
"I think instead of having Amanda's dad move in, elena should find a good man who has a clean job not a felon. she should start over. but i doubt it's going to be easy, given the fact that she has hiv"
"I want Amanda to still see her father, but that doesn<U+0092>t mean that he should move in. I get to see my dad every other weekend, because he lives in a different city, and that<U+0092>s fine. Their father is also not able to support Amanda right now, so I feel that after he is fully released, him and the mom should talk with someone about the layout for when the kids with see each parent."
"I wish they would stop pressuring her about her baby daddy coming to live with them. If someone gave me a permanent STI I would never speak to them again. There is just too much pain there. EDIT: STI stands for Sexually Transmitted Illness, you whack a mole."
"HIV is an STD, an STI is a sexually transmitted infection while and STD is a sexually transmitted disease."
"Still, if I knew that they would be a good father, I would at least give him visitation rights so that he can spend more time with his kids"
"this is a great webtoon!"
"Christmas carols and over decorated trees can<U+0092>t beat the holiday feeling you get from staring at a wall and smiling"
"nothing says Christmas like singing christmas songs and smoking bongs."
"If I don<U+0092>t see Lin Manuel Miranda once this entire WEBTOON  i will be sad"
"Remember to cover your candy canes!! XD"
"Happy holidays guys! I hope you have a great days! If you're going to party, do it safely and happily!"
"Awww he's all alone"
"Merry Christmas and happy holidays to everyone!!"
"I JUST STARTED THIS WEBTOON YESTERDAY AND IM IN LOVE OMG OMG"
"Does it really say ZERO COMMENTS?! I dOn<U+0092>T BeliEve It!!Merry Christmas everyone, or happy Hanukkah or Kwanza! Hope everyone<U+0092>s enjoying their holiday and spending it with family and friends!<U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!"
"No comments my frig- wait SWEET MOTHER OF PHILLIP THERES ONLY A REW COMMENTS HWO DOD THIS HAPPEN *silently thanks the gods of musical theatre*"
"So I got a whole bunch of missed calls from my mom tried to call back no answer so I finally got in touch with my brother my heart sank because I have another brother Who is in attic so I thought that was the final phone call that he od & died but no this was about my mother he said don<U+0092>t freak out but mommy just got diagnosed with hiv"
"She is the most kindest gentlest most beautiful list person in the world not only did she help random people especially homeless she would always help animals she is a recovering addict and I am to when I was in active addiction I made her relapse, then when I moved away to get help she relapsed every month from there and you all know what happens when you run out of money when your a woman"
"She was never promiscuous land she cries a lot because my stepfather died in the recent husband has passed away from alcohol she doesn<U+0092>t think that she is lava back or that any good man would come around her way she really said that she is OK with dying alone so if she had any relationship with anybody it was for drugs and it completely broke my heart to think my mother messed up a couple times and she was completely doomed for life"
"So I put on the bravest face I could and told her you are going to be OK this does not to fight you we are in 2018 they have so much help and resources and knowledge of the stuff that even if it<U+0092>s there it will be undetected, but in the back of my mind I couldn<U+0092>t stop hurting and thinking she was going to die even sooner, my grandpa and aunt died of aids one from a dirty needle another from *** they died within months so I was so sick to my stomach"
"Couple days past then she says that the doctors mis did something and she may not have it so she got retested we waited almost a months a lot of time for her to think for all of us to and we were okay we had accepted gods will so on  Christmas she said I have to give you your present over the phone I moved to Tampa she<U+0092>s in ny so I said okay weirdly like what could it be and she shouted out the test came back negative AND SHE DOESNT HAVE HIV"
"We couldn<U+0092>t have been more happy, but if anyone of you who read this and think well whatever she don<U+0092>t got it but I do pls don<U+0092>t ever feel like that none of this is who you are it does not change the person you are it will never make you a monster or disgusting, you guys have a purpose now more then ever there is help for all of us and when I say all I don<U+0092>t mean I have hiv I mean I need help to for the stuff I struggle with we<U+0092>re humans all flawed all not perfect all bleed the same red"
"I pray every one. Finds peace in there situation may it be big or lil we all deserve to be genuinely happy genuinely loved, happy New Year<U+0092>s Eve guys pls go get tested just Incase I know it<U+0092>s scary but you rather tackle this now while you have so many options of support and help"
"Ps sorry for the long story wish we could write more then 500 characters and if I misspelled or have words that don<U+0092>t make sense pls give all the credit to my speech text , HAPPY NEW YEARS AGAIN GUYS"
"You have a adventurous life my sympathies and happy new year thanks for sharing"
"Thank you so much notgaybutnot straight thank you for listening so wish I can say everything else had a happy ending but it<U+0092>s okay because people like you make this life thing so much easier esp with the love and support happy New Years to you and yours may god bless you in a bundance<U+2728>"
"Happy new year everyone"
"Happy Holidays and New Year...cant wait for future episodes(we still need to see how all the drama plays out)"
"Hmmmmm, am I seeing wrong or are there no coments?....this looks su***iously weird....welp whatever top coment \(<U+0095>-<U+0095>)/"
"Shoot for the starts"
"You guys are so talented amazing kind and really beautiful people thank you for allowing me to tell it and will deff check out and subscribe thank yougs happy New Years to you may all your goals and dreams be met this year<U+2728> from my family to all of yours at tested thank you so much author"
"Oh no this poor sweet girl has no idea her dads still-"
"Um well that was quiet literal"
"Utica NY?!??!? Damn we hitting a little too close to home for me"
"Quite literally, fore-shadow-ing"
"Today's tea: \"they didn't call it an epidemic until white people started dying\"."
"Damn I felt that in my soul"
"also, this looks really good!"
"no way! first comment?"
"I hate how he asked \"are you going to keep it?\"..... it? like the baby is a thing? please don't kill your children. they are living human beings. They at least deserve a chance at life."
"At least he thought about their well-being and genuinely didn<U+0092>t know how he got it."
"i feel bad for him"
"It hurts that these are real life situations"
"Thank you, also thank you for doing this. it's definitely needed and will help so many people <U+2764><U+FE0F>"
"I don't blame her but I still feel bad for him"
"Same..."
"I don't feel bad for him at all. She doesn't deserve what he did to her, intentionally or not. He was obviously into drugs and drug users are a higher risk for STDs. He brought it on himself."
"No, i don<U+0092>t blame her."
"Ayyyyy I<U+0092>m earlyyyyyy"
"Congratulations"
"I'm glad she was able to accept his help even if she can't forgive him. Please don't screw it up, dude. This is your last chance."
"I'm concerned, I want to be fully happy but I know sometimes old habits...so I'll just pray for the best."
"why don't you do an episode on how you will never be able to have a normal ***g relationship with anyone because as soon as you tell them they pity you and then stop talking to you . or mabey how you don't take your meds because u wish the shit would kill you or how you rather drop ***g dead then walk through the doors of an Infectious disease clinic again. or here's a good one how your pos baby daddy was *** a man on the side and lied to you about having HIV."
"Oof, he's probably gonna duck this up real hard"
"So Elena or her grandmother didn<U+0092>t have friends or other relatives who could babysit? What about the blonde from her school?"
"Well that problem got solved fast.Yeah, let<U+0092>s hope everything goes well"
"awww"
"So proud of his progress"
"They look like the pefect family all dressed up."
"Even if he screws it I hope he gives good times to their children."
"F*** YEAH!!!"
"Yay! Anybody can turn their lives around!!"
"he still gonna deal drugs isn't he"
"I really hope nothing bad happens but I know something will."
"Poor kid :( drugs are never the answer to anything even after you've lost everything."
"DAYUM he be as busted as Alex when mr.james renolyeds send him a letter"
"Damn..."
"*Pretend to be shock * Oh noooo"
"oh no.... too much pressure on kids added with injury and lost dreams...feelings of failure... oh no"
"Gosh darn frick frack a tic tac I just want everything to be okaaaaaayyyyyy!!!!!"
"Ah wonderful..."
"people don't knock though"
"oof"
"<U+0093>Adam?<U+0094>"
"I seriously love this art workAnd I love each episode"
"He's suffering from not only addiction but deep depression along with denial"
"Aaaand he shows no  given about his predicament."
"Well I can picture this ending well for everyone.."
"People like him are the reason why people like me, who have chronic pain and require narcotic pain medication to basically live a normal life, can<U+0092>t get the amount of medication we need! I have Sickle Cell Disease, it<U+0092>s a genetic blood disorder that doesn<U+0092>t have a cure yet"
"https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.sfgate.com/health/amp/BABY-SIBLINGS-MEDICAL-SAVIORS-Oakland-hospital-2661281.phpThere's is a cure, just how I saved my brother"
"@Uni Dasheik That<U+0092>s not a cure for everyone. You need to have an extremely close match like a full sibling in order for that to work. My only full sibling also has Sickle Cell, so that<U+0092>s not an option for me. It<U+0092>s not an option for a lot of Sickle Cell Warriors, that<U+0092>s why we need a cure that will work for everyone."
"something like that recently happened near me. Kid at a school got busted for sellin pills and stuff like that. he was charged as an adult..."
"I hope they help him before it<U+0092>s too late"
"Brothers giving him the stink eye"
"his brother needs to say something."
"Mikey is a drug addict."
"This hits too close to home... This is exactly how my brother is"
"Well the mother could also talk to him directly, or both parents can do it."
"Ugh addiction can really ruin your relationships though. Like obviously Mikey<U+0092>s sweet but he<U+0092>s not exactly reliable."
"When people are addicted, they will do things that they wouldn't normally do whilst hiding behind the person you know and love. Just because they're addicted doesn't mean to stop loving them, no. It means you need to help them as best as you can to get them away from their addiction."
"Hm...I suppose that<U+0092>s true. You never really look at that, just the addiction itself."
"This was me my life every single day it didn<U+0092>t matter what the world was doing everything had to stop for us to go to the bathroom to shootup, I was homeless 90 pounds saw and made my mother cry lost almost all of my teeth but today I can say god saved me through all of that kept me alive showed me all of that but still gave me my own choice before I kept letting him down until I grabbed his arm and pulled me out the depths of hell, I<U+0092>ll have 2 years clean June 29, when I think of drugs, or see"
"Almost my whole town I grew up in everyone is using and dieing, & looks like the walking dead, moving to Florida (no rehab no AA) and going to my Methadone clinic has changed my entire life I don<U+0092>t crave drugs want to puke when I think of them, don<U+0092>t have those thoughts or whispers in my ear saying you can sneak and do it noone will know just all of that desire left and I can say moving and the meds helped me I got my first job first house first family and a loving caring man in my life who<U+0092>d"
"Been there through all the struggles of withdrawal me throwing up all over myself sleepless nights of shaking and twitching(he<U+0092>s never done drugs) so yea moving helped a lot starting fresh helped I live as normal as I could ever be but I do mention to tell my story speak out and help as many homeless, lost or just hurting people that I come across, I try to be the kindest person I can be, because that feeling is better then any high, my heart breaks for all of us addicts"
"When I say all of us I mean yes I was an addict and still am I have an addictive personality thingy, (so I<U+0092>m not living in active addiction anymore) i wish I could like sacrifice myself for all the addicts hurting abused children, & the animals ever poor baby that<U+0092>s getting abused or is sad or anything but sadly I<U+0092>m nobody and I can<U+0092>t change any of it but maybe if I think like this maybe I<U+0092>m not the only one and maybe all of us who feel this way can get together and maybe help all those who are"
"Hurting or just stuck, many blessings to anyone who reads this entire thread I pray that god continues to bless you in this life and that your at peace have. Great day guys remember life is what you make it so pls make that sh*t ROCK"
"God why do I get the feeling either one or both of them are going to OD in there"
"....I was thinking she was pregnant but...the other implications are worse.."
"Oh no she's on drugs too"
"Damn I hope she is not breastfeeding her baby."
"Oh no. I just kinda remember that you can share HIV through needles. I didn<U+0092>t think this was where his story was going."
"Aw she<U+0092>s hooked on drugs too"
"Is it just me or does she not want to be with her baby daddy? I have a feeling that he might end up being diagnosed with HIV,,,"
"just me or are the two are getting divorce. or it. an be them getting durgs."
"Well, but then she is going to have opioid withdrawal...."
"Can cognitive behavioral therapy help people with this problem? What kinds of therapy do help people with this problem?"
"I get that taking drugs while having a baby is wrong. But still, the store owner can lose customers with that attitude of his."
"HOLY SHIT NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO DAMN DA BABY NOOOOO"
"Had no idea about that. poor baby though!"
"Ugh, maybe just maybe you shouldn<U+0092>t take a bunch of drugs when you have a baby?!"
"dose that stuff keep you from OD'ing?"
"this was so difficult to read, I'm trying to be compassionate and understanding yet part of me just wants to beat the crap out of both parents and let that baby be adopted by parents who will never harm that child. Sadly you can only help those who want it"
"sooner or later someone is going to take yhe baby away and put them in jail or prison for child endangerment."
"Is it wrong that I'd feel sad if that does happen. I want that baby to have their parents but not this way. sigh"
